# Warcraft Logs



> “But my parrrrrsseeeeeeeee” --The memes



If you’ve joined on any raids or listened in on our raid discussions, you’ve heard about parses and Warcraft logs. This is a core part of how people judge themselves and others and a good metric for how well you are progressing.



Wait. Slow down. Backup. What in the WORLD is a “parse” and what in the world does it have to do with a players abilities?



Well, lets start by talking about how Warcraft logs works and what it keeps track of.



## Reports

During raids, one of our officers or core members will combat log the fight. This tracks a lot of information about the fight, including spells cast, damage done, damage taken, position, and more! These reports are then uploaded to Warcraft logs which organizes and displays the reports in a human readable manner. You can find all of our [guilds reports here](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/guild/reports-list/199523/).

Lets dig into September 25ths reports “Memes to Dreams”. Specifically, lets look at our [Zek’Voz kill](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/tDvxKpm7n6aGyNgJ#fight=8).

There is an incredible amount of detail on this page. It certainly is information overload! Don’t be overwhelmed, we can take this piece by piece.



### Summary

In summary tab you can see a cool little graph of the raids overall per-second stats for damage done, damage taken, and healing done. This is pretty, but generally useless information. The most useful information you can get from this graph is making sure that heals are going out at appropriate times. The damage taken and healing done charts should have spikes at roughly the same times. If we don’t see spikes at the same time, healers are putting healing resources out at the wrong times.



If you look further down the page, you can see the “Damage Done By Source” and “Healing Done By Source” sections. These sections are what people most frequently come to Warcraft logs for. You can click on the “Damage Done” and “Healing Done” tabs at the top for more detailed tables. Lets click into the [“Healing Done” section](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/tDvxKpm7n6aGyNgJ#fight=8&type=healing) and get a better look at these stats.



### Damage / Healing Done

This is where you can see your “parse” number. A parse is simply a [percentile rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile_rank) for the HPS or DPS you did for that fight. In other words, in this Zek’voz kill, Darcilynn healed `20,738.6`. Of all Zek’voz kills on record, that `20,738` is in better than 97% of other resto druids heals per seconds and better than 96% of resto druids of the same ilvl.



This is usually where most people stop. Knowing where you fall on the bell curve and trying to get that number up is an admirable goal, but really the question becomes HOW do we get this number up. Luckily, Warcraft logs gives much much deeper details than just this number. Lets dig into Darcilynn’s report on this fight.
